# Hi-hat Related Downloads

This Wordpress plugin will allow you to display related downloads in your widget enabled sidebar.

## How it Works

A new Post Type named Related Downloads will be available from your Dashboard's main menu. Here you should add a title, and select the file from your Meida Library or upload a new file. After the file has been added, tag this new Post using the "Related Download Tags" metabox.

To establish a relationship between this download and your existing Posts, locate the Post in your Dashboard and tag that Post with the same tag used previously.

Now that one of your new Related Download Posts have been tagged, and one of your existing Posts have been tagged with the same tag (keyword), you should now see your new Related Download listed in the sidebar where your widget has been added.

### Widget

Simply drag and drop the widget to your sidebar and configure options.

### Shortcode

To include the Related Downloads in a Page or Post, please use the following shortcode. Post Quantity is the only available option at this time.
